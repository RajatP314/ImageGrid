# ImageGrid
Makes a grid of random images from a folder

1. Move the ImageGrid folder to your Desktop (if you know how to use the command line, ignore this)

IMPORTANT
Replace the images in the image folder with your images. Make sure the image files have no spaces in their names
------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Open up the Terminal and navigate to the this folder
  "cd Desktop/ImageGrid" without the quotes should work if you followed step 1.
  
3. Type "chmod 755 init.sh" again, without quotes
4. Type "./init.sh images" (still no quotes)
5. You should now be in a browser window. Input the relevant information and click "Create"
  (the ScaleImage options dictate what size to render the image in the grid, i.e, you can scale the images from 100x100 to 25x25)
6. "Export" resizes the canvas so you can export the image by right-clicking
